I created an interactive art museum in which users can uncover hidden paintings and sculptures using the interactable chisel and paintbrush that is given to them. 
The user is tasked with entering the museum where they are shown a graphical user interface(GUI). The GUI informs the user what they need to do, where to go, and what tool is 
required. The GUI also lets the user spawn in a paintbrush or chisel that they can use. If the user has the chisel then they will go to the stone blocks and hit them with the 
chisel to reveal sculptures. If they have the paintbrush then they will need to go to the blank canvases and paint them to reveal the hidden art work. Once the sculpture or 
artwork is revealed, the user will then be shown a plaque containing the title of the piece, who created it, and the year it was created.
